If you use ArchLinux on several machines in your home network,
you'll often download the same packages several times for different machines
when doing a system update.

Wouldn't it be nice to have a central shared cache that always gives
you the newest packages without downloading any unneded stuf?
If you own a device that can serve files over the network and is always
online, this project might be interesting for you.
